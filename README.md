This is a budgeting app built following a Youtube tutorial to get familiar using and styling Bootstrap components. Since this doesn't have any real changes over the tutorial itself, this is not on my portfolio, though I did learn a lot.

The app allows you to add, edit, and delete expenses, and shows how close to (or over) your spending limit is using dynamically rendered progress bars. I used some of what I learned from this app to make the Pokemon API's stat bars.
